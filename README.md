# Anxious Aviator 

Anxious Aviator is a site that hopes to help people overcome their fear of flying. The theme of the site is broken down into two parts; course information and knowledge. The site is targeted at people of all ages who struggle with a fear of flying and wish to overcome it. Anxious Aviator will provide information about courses being run to overcome this fear. It will also provide some information about turbulence and aircraft testing hoping to increase knowledge and understanding of these topics and overcome fear and anxiety.
